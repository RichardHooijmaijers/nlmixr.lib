* Title and description were updated as requested during review by Uwe Ligges.
* Description does not have a reference for the models.  The reason is that the
  models will have references embedded within the models themselves.  And,
  references do not typically apply for the current models (they are so commonly
  used, I do not know a specific reference for them).  Future releases will have
  references for individual models.
* \dontrun{} was removed
* Description was further updated as requested by Victoria Wimmer
* Potential file-writing false-positive was removed from comments in modellib.r
